<h3>Python Scripts for Fun ! (PSF) </h3>

<p>This is a repository where I try out new ways of automation using python. Feel free to contribute and use this repository. Thanks</p>

<h5>Contents: </h5>
<ol>
	<li>clearScreen.py - dummy function for clearing terminal screen.</li>
	<li>download.py - Downloads any file whose link is provided on terminal or stored in clipboard.</li>
	<li>explosm-comic-downloader - Downloads latest comics from explosm.net. User enters number of downloads and folder name to download in.</li>
	<li>2048-player - Opens the 2048 game and sends the UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT keys. Not an effective way, but still fun :P </li>
	<li>weatherForecast - Takes city name from user and prints the latest weather forecast by <a href="OpenWeatherMap.org">OpenWeatherMap.org</a> </li>
</ol>
